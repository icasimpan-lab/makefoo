===================
an idea how to enable custom configurations, esp for 
target environment

the configure_defs.mk shall be created in top_srcdir.
and then it must be included in makefile.

there will be a rule somewhere in defs.mk:

    include $(top_srcdir)/configure_defs.mk
    $(top_srcdir)/configure_defs.mk: 
        $(OMSBUILD)/configure.sh -o $@
        
and the configure script will:

detect configuration environment:
    compiler type (gcc, clang, cl)
    target platform (win32-msvc, win32-mingw, win64??, linux-gcc ? ...)
    
set required variables
    STATIC_LIBRARY_EXT: .a | .lib
    SHARED_LIBRARY_EXT: .so | .dll
    SHARED_LIBRARY_MODEL: dll | so
    
set EXE_EXTENSION=.exe or null
    
==================

how to build two types of targets from one component ? e.g

STATIC_LIBRARY += component
SHARED_LIBRARY += component 

??
current problem, the X_output, X_objdir and X_objects are overriden
but later target
